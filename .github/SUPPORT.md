# Getting help with watercolouR

Thanks for using watercolouR! Before filing an issue, there are a few places to
explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven't heard of or used
reprex before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your
R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty incredible ROI for the
five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional
reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)
section of the tidyverse site.

## Where to ask?

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out where to ask.

-   If it's a general question about R coding, start with
    [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/), and/or
    [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Direct questions about
    Letterblaster Press and the watercolouR R package to the [discussion
    boards](https://github.com/fascinatingfingers/watercolouR/discussions).

-   If it's a bug: you're in the right place, [file an
    issue](https://github.com/fascinatingfingers/watercolouR/issues/new).

-   If you're not sure: let the
    [community](https://github.com/fascinatingfingers/watercolouR/discussions)
    help you figure it out! If your problem *is* a bug or a feature request, you
    can easily return here and report it.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/fascinatingfingers/watercolouR/issues) to make sure
the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By
default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can [edit
the
qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply remove
`is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.

## What happens next?

Please be patient as this project gets off the ground! It may take some time to
receive a reply. If you think you might be able to implement a fix/improvement
yourself, check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a pull
request!
